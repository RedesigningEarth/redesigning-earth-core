# Patents policy (CERN OHL v2-S)

## Purpose

This project exists to keep foundational material formulations and manufacturing methods **free to use**, including for commercial services and products, while preventing patent-based enclosure of the shared core.

The repository is licensed under **CERN Open Hardware Licence v2 – Strongly Reciprocal (CERN OHL v2-S)**. The LICENSE file is authoritative.

## Practical meaning for users and companies

- You may **use, modify, manufacture, and sell** Products based on this repository.
- If you distribute a Product or publish Modified Material that is based on this repository, CERN OHL v2-S requires reciprocity for the relevant design/documentation components.
- The license includes patent-related provisions intended to prevent patents from being used as toll booths against users of the licensed material.

## Contribution rule (non-negotiable)

By contributing, you represent that:

1. You have the right to contribute the material (you did not copy restricted work).
2. Your contribution is provided under **CERN OHL v2-S**.
3. To the extent your contribution is covered by patent rights you control, your contribution is made on terms compatible with **CERN OHL v2-S**, including its patent-related provisions.

If you cannot make these representations, do not contribute.

## Defensive publication intent

This repository is published as a **defensive prior-art disclosure**. The project aims to document:
- enabling details (enough to reproduce)
- parameter ranges
- failure modes
- evidence (test logs, photos, measurements)

This improves the ability to invalidate patents that attempt to claim the already-disclosed core.

## What the project discourages

- Filing patents that attempt to lock up the shared core and then using them to restrict others.
- “Patent ambush” behavior (withholding known constraints while seeking IP leverage).

## Reporting patent concerns

If you become aware of a patent application or granted patent that appears to read on the project’s disclosed core:
- Open an Issue titled: `Patent concern: <patent/publication number>`
- Provide:
  - jurisdiction and number
  - claim excerpts (short)
  - where it overlaps with this repo (paths + commit hashes if possible)

Maintainers may respond by:
- improving disclosures (more enabling detail)
- adding prior-art references
- preparing third-party prior-art submissions where applicable
