#Open-Matrix — Structural Log

## Status
IN PROGRESS  
Mechanism exploration  
Architectural-scale LFAM execution pending

## Scope
- Open three-dimensional skeletal load-bearing matrices  
- Curvature-continuous lattices without discrete nodes  
- Integrated air volumes for thermal and acoustic performance  
- Gradient density fields aligned with load trajectories  

## Rationale
Open matrix structures replace bulk material with curvature-continuous skeletal geometry.
Structural capacity, insulation behavior, and damage tolerance emerge from geometry rather than mass.

This is treated as **structural regime exploration**, not a finalized construction typology.

## Research — Open Matrix Load-Bearing Structures

### Research scope delimitation
This section covers research on:
- open cellular and lattice materials,
- curvature-continuous skeletal architectures,
- structures where voids and solids are co-designed as a single mechanical system,
- directly manufacturable geometries compatible with extrusion-based additive manufacturing.

### Biological open-matrix archetypes
Natural load-bearing systems demonstrate extreme strength-to-weight ratios using open skeletal architectures.

Key findings:
- Load is distributed through continuous curved members.
- Failure is graceful due to redundant load paths.
- Void space is mechanically functional, not parasitic.

### Architected materials and mechanical metamaterials
Recent materials science research demonstrates that architected open matrices can outperform bulk solids when geometry is optimized.

Key findings:
- Mechanical properties scale with topology rather than material composition.
- Stretch-dominated lattices achieve high stiffness at low density.
- Hierarchical architectures outperform single-scale lattices.

### Curvature continuity and node-free lattices
Research shows that eliminating discrete nodes significantly improves mechanical performance.

Key findings:
- Node-free (TPMS-like) structures reduce stress concentrations.
- Curvature continuity improves fatigue resistance.
- Damage remains localized rather than catastrophic.

### Applicability to LFAM extrusion
While most architected material research occurs at micro–meso scale, core principles scale geometrically.

Relevant conclusions:
- Print-time stability is governed by strand bridging limits.
- Relative density can be modulated spatially via toolpath control.
- Pressure-assisted consolidation improves strand stiffness without eliminating openness.

## Interpretation (non-final)
Published research demonstrates that open skeletal matrices can achieve superior stiffness, strength, and damage tolerance when geometry is curvature-continuous and hierarchical.

Translation to LFAM depends on print-time stability and pressure-mediated consolidation rather than cured-state material strength.

## Open questions / Future scope (critical)
- Minimum strand diameter at architectural scale  
- Maximum unsupported span during extrusion  
- Pressure vs pore-collapse trade-off  
- Environmental performance of large air volumes  
- Repairability and inspection strategies  

## Position in structural roadmap
Defines the transition from solid-wall construction to geometry-dominated skeletal architectures.
