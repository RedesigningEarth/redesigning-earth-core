# Biostruct-95 — Material Log

## Status
FAILED

## Composition (wt%)
- Chitin: 50%
- Chitosan: 45%
- Sorbitol: 2.5%
- Citric acid: 2.5%

## Rationale
Baseline dry formulation intended to plasticize chitosan under heat and shear to enable solvent-free extrusion.

## Experimental results

### Lab test — Static mix heating
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Method:** Static premix, heated  
**Temperature:** 190 °C

**Observations:**
- No observable plasticizing of chitosan.
- Increasing temperature resulted in chitosan disintegration (thermal degradation behavior).

### Field test — Dyze Pulsar extrusion
**Date:** 2025-11-11  
**Equipment:** Dyze Pulsar extruder  
**Temperature:** 190 °C  
**Process note:** High shear

**Observations:**
- No observable plasticizing of chitosan under extrusion shear.
- Higher temperatures led to disintegration/degradation.

## Interpretation
- The hypothesis “chitosan plasticizes at ~190 °C under shear” is falsified under the tested conditions.
- The formulation does not provide a solvent-free melt/flow phase suitable for extrusion.

## Open questions / Future scope
None (closed result).

## Decision criteria
Classified as FAILED due to lack of plasticization and onset of degradation before usable flow.

## Position in material roadmap
Discontinues the “dry powder + low plasticizer” approach as a melt-flow strategy. Supports shifting focus toward pressure-dominated consolidation rather than melt behavior.
