# Research Conclusions and Property Derivation

This document synthesizes external research, internal experiments, and mechanism-level reasoning to derive
expected material behavior for Redesigning Earth (RE).

Properties described here are hypotheses, not validated results, unless explicitly linked to experimental data.

---

## Non-negotiable constraints
- Dry or near-dry processing (target moisture <5%)
- Structural performance required
- Automated fabrication (no closed-mold-only processes)
- Bio-derived, scalable feedstocks

## Evidence base
- External work summarized in `research-summary.md`
- Internal Biostruct experiments (`biostruct-95.md`, `biostruct-70-des.md`)
- Supplier MDS/SDS for constituent materials

## Mechanism-level reasoning

### Hydrogen bonding density
- Structural strength in polysaccharides scales with hydrogen bonding density.
- Free solvents interfere with hydrogen bonding and force post-drying.
- Post-drying introduces shrinkage/cracking/porosity.

### Pressure versus flow
- Pressure-dominated densification can yield high strength without melting (NCV-type evidence).
- Flowability is a weak predictor of final structural strength.
- Pressure is the primary lever; flow is secondary.

### Thermal limits
- Chitin/chitosan do not exhibit true melting behavior; they degrade before a usable melt phase.
- RE field testing falsifies “plasticize at ~190 °C under shear” as a general strategy.

## Derived property expectations (hypotheses)
Given dry feedstock, fine powders, temperature below degradation, and significant pressure:
- Density ↑ → stiffness/strength ↑
- Porosity ↓ → water uptake ↓
- Performance dominated by consolidation pressure, packing, and interfacial bonding (not melt flow)

## Explicit non-claims
RE does not claim:
- steel-equivalent strength
- isotropy
- melt-processability of chitin/chitosan
- validated structural performance without standardized testing

## Directional implication for RE
- Dry, pressure-dominated systems are the viable path to structural performance.
- Extrusion should be treated as a delivery mechanism for pressure, not melt processing.
- Prioritize: pressure generation, densification, moisture exclusion, and durability screening.
