# Research Summary (External Work)

This document records external research evaluated for relevance to Redesigning Earth (RE).
The goal is technical falsification/confirmation relative to RE constraints: dry or near-dry processing,
structural performance, and automated fabrication.

## Aguahoja — Oxman et al. (2017)

**Material:** Chitosan-based hydrogel in acetone solvent  
**Process:** Piston-based extrusion, layered sheet fabrication

**Reported results:**
- Thin, plastic-like sheets
- Limited structural strength

**Assessment for RE:** FAILED

**Reason for failure (RE constraints):**
- Solvent-based system limits hydrogen bonding density
- Requires solvent evaporation/post-drying (shrinkage, cracking risk)
- Not structurally relevant under RE targets

## FLAM (Fungal-like Adhesive Materials) — Fernandez et al. (2018)

**Material:** Chitosan–cellulose composite in aqueous solvent  
**Process:** Extrusion-based deposition with post-processing

**Reported results:**
- Foam-like, porous structures
- Requires drying/freezing-type post-processing to stabilize

**Assessment for RE:** FAILED

**Reason for failure (RE constraints):**
- Dependence on water solvent
- Post-drying introduces shrinkage/cracking and dimensional instability
- Final structural performance limited

## Nano-Cellulose Vehicle (NCV) — pressure-molded nanocellulose systems

**Material:** Nanocellulose paste  
**Process:** High-pressure molding (non-additive)

**Reported results:**
- Extremely high mechanical strength due to densification and hydrogen bonding

**Assessment for RE:** FAILED (process incompatibility)

**Reason for failure (RE constraints):**
- Not compatible with additive manufacturing (requires closed molds)
- Still relevant as a mechanism demonstration: pressure-driven hydrogen bonding

**Representative sources:**
- Nanocellulose review: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/19/3483

## Summary relevance to RE
Across reviewed work:
- Solvent-based systems enable formability but limit structural strength.
- Post-drying introduces shrinkage, cracking, and porosity.
- Maximum strength correlates with pressure-dominated consolidation rather than melt flow.
