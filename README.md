# Materials

This folder contains **primary material logs** and **research synthesis** for Redesigning Earth.

## Conventions
- **One formulation = one material log** (`biostruct-*.md`).
- Logs keep *observations* and *test conditions* separate from *interpretation*.
- Attachments (photos, PDFs) live in `materials/attachments/` and are referenced by **relative paths**.
- Status is semantic (PASSED / IN PROGRESS / FAILED). Formatting does not encode status.

## Contents
- `biostruct-95.md` — dry chitin/chitosan + sorbitol/citric acid (FAILED)
- `biostruct-70-des.md` — DES-enabled system (IN PROGRESS, current frontier)
- `research-summary.md` — external work reviewed (links)
- `research-conclusions.md` — integrated conclusions + property-derivation
