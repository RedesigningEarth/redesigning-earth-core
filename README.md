# Redesigning Earth — Core

Redesigning Earth develops and validates an automated construction system adapted to post-industrial constraints:
- locally producible, renewable biological materials
- large-scale additive manufacturing under persistent labor scarcity

This repository contains the core technical work: materials, processes, hardware concepts, and validation data.

## Scope
Included:
- chitin / chitosan-based composite formulations
- extrusion and printhead concepts
- process parameters and protocols
- mechanical and environmental testing data

Excluded:
- marketing content
- speculative concepts without experimental backing

## Status
Active research and prototyping.
Expect incomplete documentation and iteration.
