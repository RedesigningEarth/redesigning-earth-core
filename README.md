# Self-Supporting Cell

## Definition
A **self-supporting cell** is the minimum viable unit of a stable built environment under post-industrial conditions.

Rather than treating buildings as static objects, the cell is defined as a **closed-loop habitat system** that integrates structure and essential life-support functions by design. Each cell minimizes external dependencies while remaining scalable, repeatable, and locally adaptable.

This branch defines the six **critical fields** that together constitute a self-supporting habitat. Each field will be explored in depth in future, dedicated research documents. This README establishes the system logic and boundary conditions.

## 1. Shelter
**Function:** Physical protection and habitable interior conditions.

Shelter provides:
- wind and rain protection,
- thermal buffering and climate control,
- acoustic shielding,
- and full support for modern amenities (lighting, sanitation, connectivity).

In the context of Redesigning Earth, shelter is not a passive enclosure but a **structural interface** that integrates:
- load-bearing geometry,
- insulation and thermal mass,
- utility routing,
- and environmental control surfaces.

The shelter subsystem is designed for **direct LFAM construction**, enabling rapid deployment, geometric freedom, and functional integration without secondary finishing stages.

## 2. Energy
**Function:** Autonomous energy generation, storage, and distribution.

Primary energy source:
- **Solar photovoltaic (PV)** integrated into roofs and exposed surfaces.

Core components:
- in-house electrical storage (battery systems),
- local smart micro-grid management,
- load balancing across shelter, water, and material systems.

Secondary energy stream:
- **Methane generated from organic waste processing**, used for:
  - hot water production,
  - low-grade thermal loads,
  - and optional visual fireplace applications (non-essential, psychological / social value).

Energy systems are designed to prioritize:
- reliability,
- local control,
- and graceful degradation rather than maximum peak output.

## 3. Water
**Function:** Closed-loop water capture, purification, use, and reuse.

Primary source:
- **Rainwater capture**, collected via green roofs acting as a first-stage biological and particulate filter.

Water streams:
- potable water: further filtered to drinking-water quality,
- grey water: recycled for toilet flushing and non-potable uses,
- black water: routed to waste-processing systems.

Design principles:
- gravity-first routing where possible,
- redundancy in filtration,
- and continuous monitoring rather than centralized treatment dependence.

## 4. Food
**Function:** Local, resilient food production integrated into daily life.

Food production operates at multiple scales:
- **Mini food forests** on roofs, terraces, and gardens,
- **Larger food forests, polycultures, and silvopasture** in surrounding rural land.

Key principles:
- perennial systems over annual monocultures,
- biodiversity as a stability mechanism,
- integration with water and waste flows.

Food is treated as:
- nutrition,
- ecosystem maintenance,
- and a primary source of biomass for downstream systems.

## 5. Waste Processing
**Function:** Conversion of biological waste into energy and raw material streams.

Input streams:
- domestic organic waste,
- cooking waste,
- human excreta.

Primary process:
- **Underwater anaerobic processing**, producing methane as a usable energy carrier.

Secondary outputs:
- stabilized organic matter,
- nutrient-rich residues suitable for soil systems,
- biomass streams routed toward material production.

Additionally:
- harvesting, pruning, and maintenance waste from food systems is collected and processed rather than discarded.

Waste is treated as a **resource routing problem**, not a disposal problem.

---

## 6. Material Production
**Function:** Local production of structural feedstock.

Material production closes the loop by converting food-system waste into **chitin-rich mycelium**.

Process logic:
- food production waste → fungal growth substrate,
- fungal biomass rich in chitin → dried and processed feedstock,
- feedstock → **Biostruct LFAM** for:
  - shelter expansion,
  - infrastructure,
  - tools and components.

This subsystem enables:
- continuous material regeneration,
- drastic reduction of external material supply chains,
- and direct coupling between ecological productivity and built environment growth.

## System Boundary and Next Steps
A self-supporting cell is defined by **functional closure**, not isolation. Cells may exchange surplus energy, food, or materials, but remain operationally viable in isolation.

Future research in this branch will consist of:
- one dedicated `.md` file per field,
- quantitative performance envelopes,
- failure-mode analysis,
- and integration constraints with Biostruct LFAM construction.

This README serves as the **system-level reference** for all subsequent work in the `self-supporting-cell` branch.
