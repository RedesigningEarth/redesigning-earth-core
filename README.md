# Structures

This folder contains **structural design logics** by bio-based large-scale additive manufacturing.

## Conventions
- Structures are treated as functional systems, not static solid.
- Status is semantic (PASSED / IN PROGRESS / FAILED). Formatting does not encode status.

## Contents
- `open-matrix.md` — open matrix load-bearing structures for material efficiency and insulation properties (IN PROGRESS)
- `structural-colors.md` — post-processing femtosecond LIPSS laser–encoded structural coloration and surface finish (IN PROGRESS)
- `utility-voids.md` — integrated utility voids in LFAM workflow (IN PROGRESS)
