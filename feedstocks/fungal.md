## Fungal-based chitin and chitosan feedstocks

Fungal feedstocks align with the objective of fully local, circular material production using biological growth on waste streams.

At present, fungal chitin remains **pre-industrial**.

### Kitozyme

**Feedstock type**  
Fungal chitosan (glucan-rich)

**Chitin availability**  
None

**Technical assessment**
- High β-glucan content
- Chemistry diverges from chitin–chitosan structural system
- Not compatible with current Biostruct formulations

**Production status**  
Industrial

**Conclusion**  
Not viable for current structural materials.

### Maicelium

**Feedstock type**  
Fungal chitin and chitosan

**Chitin availability**  
Yes (pure fungal-derived)

**Technical assessment**
- Chemically suitable
- Limited production volume
- Moisture control and consistency still under development

**Production status**  
Experimental / early-stage

**Conclusion**  
Strategically promising long-term feedstock requiring scaling.
