## /materials/feedstock

This branch documents viable biological feedstocks for chitin- and chitosan-based materials used in the Redesigning Earth construction system.

Two feedstock classes are maintained:

- **Fungal-derived chitin / chitosan** – preferred long-term option for circular, locally grown material systems.
- **Shellfish-derived chitin / chitosan** – currently the only industrially validated feedstock meeting all technical constraints.

### Branch contents

- `fungal.md`
- `shellfish.md`

---

### Non-negotiable feedstock constraints

- Moisture content ≤ **5% target**
- Compatible with **dry compounding, pelletization, and high-pressure extrusion**
- Scalable toward **construction-scale volumes**
- Chemical consistency suitable for **hydrogen-bond–activated structural composites**
